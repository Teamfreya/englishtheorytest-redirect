    <h1>Getting a Danish Driving Licence as an Expat</h1>
    <p class="lead">Whether you can exchange your licence or need to start from scratch depends on where you're from. Here's exactly what you need to do.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <div class="article-body">

        <h2>The 90-Day Rule</h2>
        <p>Once you establish residency in Denmark (by getting a CPR number and registering your address), the clock starts ticking. As a new resident, you have <strong>90 days</strong> to either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Exchange</strong> your foreign licence for a Danish one (if eligible), or</li>
            <li><strong>Begin the process</strong> of obtaining a new Danish licence</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After 90 days, your foreign driving licence is no longer valid for driving in Denmark (with some exceptions for EU/EEA citizens).</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Residency requirement:</strong> You must be registered with a Danish address in the Civil Registration Office (Folkeregisteret) and reside in Denmark at least 185 days per year.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Path 1: EU/EEA Licence Holders</h2>
        <p>If you hold a valid driving licence from an <strong>EU or EEA country</strong> (plus Switzerland), you're in the simplest situation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You <strong>can drive legally</strong> in Denmark with your existing licence — no exchange required</li>
            <li>If you <strong>want to exchange</strong> it for a Danish licence (recommended for long-term residents), no driving test is needed</li>
            <li>The exchange costs <strong>520 DKK</strong></li>
            <li>You'll need to visit your local Citizen Service centre (Borgerservice) with your licence, passport, and a recent photo</li>
        </ul>
        <p>EU/EEA countries include: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.</p>

        <h2>Path 2: Countries with Exchange Agreements</h2>
        <p>Denmark has bilateral agreements with certain countries that allow <strong>direct licence exchange without a test</strong>. These currently include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Australia</li>
            <li>Canada (some provinces)</li>
            <li>Israel</li>
            <li>Japan</li>
            <li>South Korea</li>
            <li>Switzerland (also covered by EEA rules)</li>
            <li>Taiwan</li>
            <li>Turkey</li>
            <li>United Kingdom (post-Brexit agreement)</li>
            <li>United States (specific states only — check with Færdselsstyrelsen)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your country is on this list, you can exchange your licence at Borgerservice for <strong>520 DKK</strong> without taking a driving test. You'll need your original licence, a Danish translation if it's not in Latin script, and valid photo ID.</p>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Exchange agreements can change. Always verify the current list with the <strong>Danish Road Traffic Authority</strong> (Færdselsstyrelsen) before making plans.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Path 3: All Other Countries — Full Danish Licence Process</h2>
        <p>If your country is <strong>not</strong> on the exchange list, you must go through the <strong>complete Danish driving licence process</strong> — regardless of your driving experience. This means:</p>

        <h3>Step 1: Enrol at a Driving School</h3>
        <p>Find an approved Danish driving school (køreskole). Many in Copenhagen, Aarhus, and other cities offer instruction in English. Expect to pay <strong>12,000–18,000 DKK</strong> for the full course.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Complete Mandatory Lessons</h3>
        <p>For a category B (car) licence, you need:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>29 theory lessons</strong> (classroom instruction)</li>
            <li><strong>At least 16 practical driving lessons</strong> (many students need more)</li>
            <li><strong>4 lessons on a manoeuvre course</strong> (slippery surface, emergency braking)</li>
            <li><strong>First aid course</strong> (8 hours, separate from the driving school)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 3: Pass the Theory Test</h3>
        <p>The theory test (teoriprøve) is a 25-minute digital exam with 25 traffic scenarios. You can take it in <strong>English</strong>. The test fee is <strong>600 DKK</strong> per attempt.</p>
        <p>This is where KørApp comes in — it gives you all the official practice questions in English so you can prepare effectively for just 99 DKK.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Pass the Practical Driving Test</h3>
        <p>After passing the theory test, you take the practical driving test. A test examiner sits in the car with you and your instructor, and you drive on public roads for about 25 minutes. The test fee is <strong>890 DKK</strong>.</p>

        <h3>Step 5: Get Your Licence</h3>
        <p>Once you pass both tests, your driving school submits the paperwork. You'll receive your Danish driving licence (pink card format) within a few weeks. The licence issue fee is <strong>520 DKK</strong>.</p>

        <h2>Total Cost Breakdown for Non-EU Expats</h2>
        <table class="comparison-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Item</th>
                    <th>Cost (DKK)</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Driving school package</td>
                    <td>12,000–18,000</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>First aid course</td>
                    <td>600–900</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Theory test (per attempt)</td>
                    <td>600</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Practical test (per attempt)</td>
                    <td>890</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Licence issue</td>
                    <td>520</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>KørApp (theory practice)</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>99</strong></td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Total estimate</strong></td>
                    <td><strong>14,700–21,000</strong></td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>Given the total cost, failing the theory test and having to retake it (another 600 DKK plus weeks of delay) is something you absolutely want to avoid. Spending 99 DKK on KørApp to maximise your chance of passing the first time is an obvious decision.</p>

        <h2>Finding an English-Speaking Driving School</h2>
        <p>Many driving schools in Denmark offer lessons in English, especially in larger cities. When choosing a school, ask about:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> Do they teach theory lessons in English, or only practical lessons?</li>
            <li><strong>Package price:</strong> What's included? How many lessons?</li>
            <li><strong>Additional lesson cost:</strong> If you need more lessons beyond the package, what's the per-lesson price?</li>
            <li><strong>Pass rate:</strong> What percentage of their students pass on the first attempt?</li>
            <li><strong>Timeline:</strong> How long will the full process take?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Expat Questions</h2>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Can I use an International Driving Permit (IDP) in Denmark?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>An IDP is valid for tourists and short-term visitors. Once you establish residency (get a CPR number), the IDP is no longer valid for driving in Denmark. You must exchange your licence or get a Danish one within 90 days.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">I have a UK licence. Can I still exchange it after Brexit?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>Yes. Denmark and the UK have a bilateral agreement that allows direct licence exchange without a driving test. Visit Borgerservice with your UK licence, passport, and a recent photo.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">I'm a US citizen. Can I exchange my licence?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>It depends on which state issued your licence. Denmark has agreements with some US states but not all. Check the current list with Færdselsstyrelsen. If your state isn't listed, you'll need to go through the full Danish process.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How long does the full process take?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>For non-EU expats going through the complete process: typically <strong>3–6 months</strong> from enrollment to getting your licence. The timeline depends on lesson availability, test centre booking times, and how quickly you progress.</p>
