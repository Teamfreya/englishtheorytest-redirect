    <h1>10 Tips to Pass the Danish Theory Test on the First Try</h1>
    <p class="lead">The Danish theory test has a reputation for being tough — especially for people who've driven in other countries. Here's how to avoid the most common pitfalls and pass on your first attempt.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <div class="article-body">

        <h2>1. Don't Rely on Driving Experience Alone</h2>
        <p>This is the number one mistake, especially among expats who've been driving for years. The Danish theory test isn't about whether you can drive — it's about whether you know <strong>Danish traffic rules specifically</strong>. Rules about right of way, speed limits, and signalling are different in Denmark compared to the UK, US, or other countries.</p>
        <p>Even if you've been driving for 20 years, study the Danish rules as if you're learning from scratch.</p>

        <h2>2. Master the Right-of-Way Rules</h2>
        <p>Right of way (vigepligt) is the topic that fails the most people. The key rules to memorise:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>The right-hand rule:</strong> At unmarked intersections, you must give way to traffic coming from your right</li>
            <li><strong>Yield signs (shark teeth):</strong> The triangle yield sign and the shark-tooth road markings mean you must give way to all traffic on the road you're entering</li>
            <li><strong>Priority roads:</strong> The yellow diamond sign means you're on a priority road — you have right of way at the next intersection</li>
            <li><strong>Exiting roundabouts:</strong> When leaving a roundabout, you must yield to cyclists in the bike lane on your right</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>Pro tip:</strong> In the test, always check for cyclists. Denmark has extensive bike lanes, and many questions test whether you'd check for cyclists before turning right.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. Learn the Danish Speed Limits by Heart</h2>
        <p>You'll be asked about speed limits repeatedly. The defaults are simple but absolute:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>50 km/h</strong> in built-up areas — look for the white city name sign</li>
            <li><strong>80 km/h</strong> on rural roads</li>
            <li><strong>130 km/h</strong> on motorways (110 km/h on some stretches)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Watch for signs that override the default. And remember: when you pass a city name sign with a red line through it, you're back to the 80 km/h rural limit.</p>

        <h2>4. Do at Least 20 Full Practice Tests</h2>
        <p>The single most effective preparation method is taking <strong>full-length mock tests</strong> under real conditions. Set a 25-minute timer and answer all 25 scenarios. This builds familiarity with the test format and helps you manage your time.</p>
        <p>With KørApp, you can take unlimited mock tests that mirror the real exam format — all in English, on your phone.</p>

        <h2>5. Study the Signs, Not Just the Rules</h2>
        <p>Many questions show a traffic scenario with specific signs visible. If you don't recognise the sign, you can't answer the question. Pay special attention to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Signs that look similar but mean different things (e.g., no parking vs. no stopping)</li>
            <li>Supplementary signs (small rectangular signs below main signs that add conditions)</li>
            <li>Zone signs (e.g., 30 km/h zone) — they apply until you see the end-of-zone sign</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Read Every Sub-Question Carefully</h2>
        <p>The test is designed to trick you with careful wording. A question might say "You <strong>must</strong> stop" vs. "You <strong>may</strong> proceed" — one word changes the entire answer. Read each statement twice before answering.</p>
        <p>Also pay attention to negatives: "You do <strong>not</strong> need to signal" is easy to misread under time pressure.</p>

        <h2>7. Don't Rush — You Have More Time Than You Think</h2>
        <p>25 minutes for 25 scenarios might sound tight, but most people finish with time to spare. Take 30–60 seconds per scenario. Look carefully at the image, identify all vehicles, signs, and road markings, then answer the sub-questions.</p>
        <p>If you're unsure about a question, make your best guess and move on. You can have up to 5 wrong answers and still pass.</p>

        <h2>8. Focus on Your Weak Topics</h2>
        <p>After a few practice tests, you'll notice patterns — maybe you consistently get roundabout questions wrong, or you struggle with parking rules. Spend extra time on those specific topics.</p>
        <p>KørApp tracks your performance by category and shows you exactly which areas need more work. This is much more efficient than re-studying everything equally.</p>

        <h2>9. Learn the Danish Context</h2>
        <p>Even if you take the test in English, the scenarios are set on <strong>Danish roads</strong>. Understanding Danish road culture helps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Cyclists are everywhere — always check bike lanes before turning</li>
            <li>Headlights must be on at all times, even during the day</li>
            <li>Denmark uses right-hand traffic (drive on the right)</li>
            <li>Pedestrians at unmarked crossings generally have priority</li>
            <li>The "2-second rule" for following distance is standard</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>10. Take the Test When You're Ready, Not When You're Rushed</h2>
        <p>Don't book the test until you're consistently scoring <strong>20+ correct out of 25</strong> on practice tests. The test fee is 600 DKK per attempt, and rebooking wastes time. It's much cheaper to spend another week practising than to pay for a second test.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>The KørApp benchmark:</strong> If you can pass 5 practice tests in a row in the app with no more than 3 errors each, you're ready for the real thing.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Common Mistakes That Fail People</h2>
        <p>Based on patterns from thousands of test-takers:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Forgetting to check for cyclists</strong> when turning right — this catches people from countries without strong cycling culture</li>
            <li><strong>Confusing the right-hand rule</strong> with rules from their home country</li>
            <li><strong>Not knowing what supplementary signs mean</strong> — the small signs below main signs</li>
            <li><strong>Misreading "must" vs. "may"</strong> in question statements</li>
            <li><strong>Underestimating the test</strong> and not practising enough because they can already drive</li>
        </ul>
