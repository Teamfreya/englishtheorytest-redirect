        <h2>What Is the Danish Theory Test (Teoriprøve)?</h2>
        <p>The <strong>teoriprøve</strong> is the mandatory theory examination you must pass to get a Danish driving licence (kørekort). It's administered by the <strong>Danish Road Traffic Authority</strong> (Færdselsstyrelsen) at official test centres across Denmark.</p>
        <p>The test has been <strong>fully digital</strong> since 2024. You take it on a touchscreen computer at a Færdselsstyrelsen test centre. The test presents realistic traffic scenarios using images and 3D video, and you answer questions about what the correct action would be.</p>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Key fact:</strong> The Danish theory test is available in <strong>English</strong> at all digital test centres. You choose your language when you start the test.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Test Format and Structure</h2>
        <p>Here's exactly what the theory test looks like:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>25 scenarios</strong> — each one is an image or short video showing a traffic situation</li>
            <li><strong>2–4 sub-questions per scenario</strong> — each is a yes/no statement about the situation (e.g., "You must give way to the blue car")</li>
            <li><strong>25 minutes</strong> total time to complete the test</li>
            <li><strong>Maximum 5 errors</strong> allowed — if you get 6 or more wrong answers, you fail</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The scenarios cover a wide range of traffic situations: intersections, roundabouts, motorway driving, parking, pedestrian crossings, and more. Some scenarios are straightforward; others are deliberately tricky with multiple vehicles and complex right-of-way rules.</p>

        <h2>Topics Covered on the Test</h2>
        <p>The Danish theory test covers eight main topic areas. Here's what you need to study:</p>

        <h3>1. Right of Way (Vigepligt)</h3>
        <p>This is the most important topic and the one most people fail on. You need to know who has priority at intersections, T-junctions, and when merging. Key rules include the "right-hand rule" (give way to traffic from the right at unmarked intersections), priority road signs, and yield signs.</p>

        <h3>2. Traffic Signs and Road Markings</h3>
        <p>You must recognise all Danish traffic signs and understand what they mean. This includes warning signs (triangular), prohibition signs (round with red border), mandatory signs (round with blue background), and information signs (square/rectangular). Road markings like solid lines, dashed lines, and stop lines are also tested.</p>

        <h3>3. Speed Limits</h3>
        <p>Denmark has three default speed limits you must know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>50 km/h</strong> — in built-up areas (cities and towns)</li>
            <li><strong>80 km/h</strong> — on rural roads outside built-up areas</li>
            <li><strong>130 km/h</strong> — on motorways (some sections are 110 km/h)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You also need to know about speed zone signs that override the defaults, and that the speed limit for cars towing a trailer is lower (80 km/h on motorways).</p>

        <h3>4. Roundabouts and Lane Positioning</h3>
        <p>Roundabouts are very common in Denmark. You need to know how to choose the correct lane when entering and exiting, when to signal, and who has right of way. Multi-lane roundabouts are a frequent source of test questions.</p>

        <h3>5. Hazard Awareness</h3>
        <p>Questions about anticipating dangers: cyclists in blind spots, children near schools, slippery roads, and reduced visibility. You need to demonstrate that you drive defensively and anticipate what other road users might do.</p>

        <h3>6. Vehicle Knowledge</h3>
        <p>Basic knowledge about your vehicle: tyre tread depth requirements (minimum 1.6mm), when to use headlights (required at all times in Denmark), how ABS and ESP work, and what warning lights mean.</p>

        <h3>7. First Aid</h3>
        <p>What to do at an accident scene: securing the area, calling 112, basic first aid techniques, and the recovery position. You're also required to complete a separate first aid course before taking the theory test.</p>

        <h3>8. Environmental Driving</h3>
        <p>Eco-driving techniques: gear shifting for fuel efficiency, avoiding unnecessary idling, tyre pressure and its effect on fuel consumption, and when to turn off the engine.</p>

        <h2>How to Register for the Theory Test</h2>
        <p>You can't just show up and take the test. Here's the process:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Enrol at a driving school</strong> — you must be registered with an approved Danish driving school (køreskole)</li>
            <li><strong>Complete mandatory lessons</strong> — 29 theory lessons and a minimum of 16 practical driving lessons for category B</li>
            <li><strong>Complete a first aid course</strong> — this is a mandatory 8-hour course</li>
            <li><strong>Your driving school registers you</strong> — your instructor submits your registration to Færdselsstyrelsen</li>
            <li><strong>Book the test</strong> — once registered, you book a time slot at a test centre</li>
            <li><strong>Take the test</strong> — bring valid photo ID (passport or residence card)</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Important:</strong> You must be at least <strong>17 years old</strong> to take the theory test for a category B (car) licence in Denmark.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>What Happens If You Fail?</h2>
        <p>If you fail the theory test, you can retake it. However:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must <strong>pay the test fee again</strong> (600 DKK per attempt)</li>
            <li>You need to <strong>wait for a new time slot</strong>, which can take days to weeks depending on your location</li>
            <li>There is no limit on the number of retakes, but costs add up quickly</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is why thorough preparation is so important — and why using a practice app like KørApp is a smart investment at just 99 DKK.</p>

        <h2>How to Prepare Effectively</h2>
        <p>Based on data from thousands of successful test-takers, here's the most effective preparation strategy:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Study the theory material</strong> from your driving school first</li>
            <li><strong>Start practising with mock tests</strong> early — ideally 2–3 weeks before your test date</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on your weak areas</strong> — use an app that tracks your performance by topic</li>
            <li><strong>Do at least 20 full mock tests</strong> before the real exam</li>
            <li><strong>Learn the tricky scenarios</strong> — right-of-way at unmarked intersections and multi-lane roundabouts</li>
        </ol>

        <p>KørApp gives you all of this: realistic mock tests, topic-by-topic practice, and progress tracking — all in English, all offline, for a one-time price of 99 DKK.</p>
