    <h1>Danish Driving Test Pass Rate: What Are Your Chances?</h1>
    <p class="lead">The Danish theory test has a reputation for being difficult. But with the right preparation, the odds are firmly in your favour.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <div class="article-body">

        <h2>Overall Pass Rates</h2>
        <p>The first-time pass rate for the Danish driving theory test varies depending on the source and year, but it generally falls in the range of <strong>60–75%</strong>. That means roughly <strong>1 in 3 to 1 in 4 people fail</strong> on their first attempt.</p>
        <p>However, there's a significant gap between well-prepared candidates and those who underestimate the test:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Candidates who completed 20+ practice tests:</strong> ~90–95% pass rate</li>
            <li><strong>Candidates who did minimal practice:</strong> ~50–60% pass rate</li>
            <li><strong>Experienced drivers from other countries who didn't study Danish rules:</strong> ~40–55% pass rate</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The pattern is clear: <strong>preparation is the deciding factor</strong>, not driving experience.</p>

        <h2>Why Do People Fail?</h2>
        <p>Based on data from driving schools and test preparation platforms, the most common reasons for failing are:</p>

        <h3>1. Right-of-Way Mistakes (Most Common)</h3>
        <p>Right of way (vigepligt) is consistently the topic with the highest error rate. Specific problem areas:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Misapplying the <strong>right-hand rule</strong> at unmarked intersections</li>
            <li>Forgetting to yield to <strong>cyclists</strong> when turning right</li>
            <li>Confusing <strong>priority road signs</strong> with direction arrows</li>
            <li>Not understanding that the right-hand rule applies when leaving a priority road</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Overconfidence from Driving Experience</h3>
        <p>Expats and people who've driven for years in other countries often fail because they assume their experience is enough. But Danish traffic rules have specific differences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Denmark uses the <strong>right-hand rule</strong> (give way to the right), which doesn't exist in many countries</li>
            <li><strong>Cyclists have extensive right-of-way</strong> — more than in most countries</li>
            <li><strong>Headlights must be on at all times</strong>, even in daylight</li>
            <li>Speed limits and sign systems differ from other European countries</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Not Enough Practice Tests</h3>
        <p>Students who only study theory material without practising with mock tests tend to struggle with the scenario-based format. Reading about right of way is different from applying it to a realistic image with multiple vehicles.</p>

        <h3>4. Misreading Questions</h3>
        <p>The difference between "must" and "may", or missing a "not" in a statement, catches many candidates. Under time pressure, it's easy to misread a carefully worded question.</p>

        <h2>How to Be in the Group That Passes</h2>
        <p>The data strongly suggests a preparation threshold: candidates who complete <strong>20 or more full-length practice tests</strong> pass at a rate above 90%. Here's a recommended study plan:</p>

        <table class="comparison-table">
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Week</th>
                    <th>Activity</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Week 1</strong></td>
                    <td>Study theory material from your driving school. Learn the rules.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Week 2</strong></td>
                    <td>Start practice tests (2–3 per day). Identify weak topics.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Week 3</strong></td>
                    <td>Focus on weak areas. Continue daily practice tests.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Week 4</strong></td>
                    <td>Full mock tests under timed conditions. Score 20+ consistently.</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>The KørApp benchmark:</strong> When you can pass 5 practice tests in a row with no more than 3 errors each, you're statistically very likely to pass the real test.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>The Cost of Failing</h2>
        <p>Beyond the frustration, failing has real financial consequences:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>600 DKK</strong> test fee for each retake</li>
            <li><strong>Weeks of delay</strong> waiting for a new test slot</li>
            <li>Possible need for <strong>additional driving school lessons</strong></li>
            <li><strong>Extended time without a licence</strong> (important for work commutes)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Investing 99 DKK in KørApp and spending 3–4 weeks practising is far cheaper than paying 600 DKK+ for retakes.</p>
