    <h1>Danish Driving Licence for International Students</h1>
    <p class="lead">If you're studying in Denmark and want to drive, the rules depend on where you're from and how long you're staying. Here's what you need to know.</p>
</header>

<div class="container">
    <div class="article-body">

        <h2>The Key Question: Are You a "Resident"?</h2>
        <p>Everything depends on whether Denmark considers you a <strong>resident</strong>. The rule is:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Resident:</strong> You have a CPR number and live in Denmark for 185+ days per year</li>
            <li><strong>Non-resident (visitor/temporary):</strong> You're in Denmark for less than 185 days per year</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most full-degree students (bachelor's, master's) who register with a CPR number are considered residents. Exchange students on a one-semester programme (under 6 months) may not be.</p>

        <h2>Scenario 1: EU/EEA Student with a Valid Licence</h2>
        <p>If you're from an EU/EEA country and have a valid driving licence:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>You can drive in Denmark</strong> with your existing licence — no exchange needed</li>
            <li>This applies whether you're a short-term exchange student or a full-degree student</li>
            <li>If you want to <strong>exchange your licence</strong> for a Danish one, you can do so at Borgerservice for 520 DKK without any tests</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="info-box">
            <p><strong>Tip for EU students:</strong> If you're staying for a full degree (2+ years), exchanging your licence is a good idea. It simplifies things if you ever need to prove your driving privileges in Denmark.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Scenario 2: Non-EU Student with a Valid Licence</h2>
        <p>If you're from outside the EU/EEA:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Short-term (under 185 days):</strong> You can drive with your foreign licence plus an International Driving Permit (IDP). Get the IDP in your home country before traveling</li>
            <li><strong>Long-term (over 185 days / CPR registered):</strong> Once you're a resident, you have <strong>90 days</strong> to either exchange your licence (if your country has an agreement) or start the full Danish licence process</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Countries with Exchange Agreements</h3>
        <p>If your home country is on Denmark's exchange list, you can exchange your licence without taking tests. Key countries popular with international students:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Australia, Canada (some provinces), Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, UK, US (some states)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Check our <a href="/expats">expat guide</a> for the full list.</p>

        <h3>Countries Without Exchange Agreements</h3>
        <p>If your country isn't on the list (common for students from India, China, Brazil, Nigeria, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and many others), you must go through the <strong>full Danish driving licence process</strong>:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Enrol at a driving school (12,000–18,000 DKK)</li>
            <li>Complete mandatory theory + driving lessons</li>
            <li>Complete first aid course (600–900 DKK)</li>
            <li>Pass the theory test in English (600 DKK)</li>
            <li>Pass the practical driving test (890 DKK)</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Scenario 3: Student Without Any Licence</h2>
        <p>If you don't have a driving licence at all and want to get one in Denmark:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must be at least <strong>17 years old</strong></li>
            <li>You need a <strong>CPR number</strong> and valid residence permit</li>
            <li>Follow the full process above (driving school, tests, etc.)</li>
            <li>Total cost: approximately <strong>15,000–20,000 DKK</strong></li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Is It Worth Getting a Danish Licence as a Student?</h2>
        <p>Honestly, it depends on your situation:</p>

        <h3>Probably Yes If:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You plan to <strong>stay in Denmark after graduation</strong></li>
            <li>You <strong>need a car for work or daily life</strong> (common outside Copenhagen)</li>
            <li>You're from a non-EU country and your licence <strong>won't be valid</strong> after 90 days anyway</li>
            <li>You want a <strong>Danish licence as ID</strong> — it's a commonly accepted form of identification in Denmark</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Probably Not If:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>You're on a <strong>short exchange</strong> (one semester) — the process takes 3–6 months</li>
            <li>You live in <strong>Copenhagen</strong> — public transport and cycling are excellent, and parking is expensive</li>
            <li>Your <strong>budget is tight</strong> — 15,000+ DKK is a significant expense for a student</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Tips for Students Going Through the Process</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Start early</strong> — don't wait until your 90-day deadline. Enrol at a driving school as soon as you know you need a Danish licence</li>
            <li><strong>Look for student discounts</strong> — some driving schools offer reduced rates for students</li>
            <li><strong>Use KørApp for theory prep</strong> — at 99 DKK, it's by far the cheapest way to prepare for the theory test. Compare this to other platforms charging 199–399 DKK</li>
            <li><strong>Study in English</strong> — both the theory test and KørApp are available in English, so language isn't a barrier</li>
            <li><strong>Group study</strong> — study with fellow students who are also preparing. Discussing scenarios helps understanding</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="tip-box">
            <p><strong>Student budget tip:</strong> KørApp is 99 DKK once — no subscription. That's less than one month of a Spotify subscription. And it could save you 600 DKK by helping you pass the theory test on the first try.</p>
